# Street-View-Housing-Number-Digit-Recognition
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition 
algorithms with the minimal requirement on data formatting.The purpose of this project is to build a Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition 
model using the concepts of Deep Learning by building a digit classifier on the SVHN (Street 
View Housing Number) dataset.
